## Project Description
A hilariously satisfying yet completely pointless digital experience that lets users pop virtual bubble wrap or smash virtual glass—no cleanup required!

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People waste time popping bubble wrap or smashing glass in real life. Let's solve that nonexistent problem… virtually!

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We recreated bubble wrap popping and glass smashing with immersive visuals and lifelike sounds—purely for stress relief and fun.
