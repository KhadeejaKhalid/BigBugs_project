# Virtual Bubble Wrap & Virtual Smashing Glass
**Team:** BigBites

## Overview
This project is a fun and completely 'useless' interactive experience designed to bring satisfaction and stress relief to users. It includes two main features:
1. **Virtual Bubble Wrap** – Click or tap to pop bubbles with realistic sound and animation.
2. **Virtual Smashing Glass** – Click to smash virtual glass with lifelike shattering effects and sounds.

## Purpose
The goal is to recreate the joy of popping bubble wrap and breaking glass without any mess or waste. It's purely for entertainment, built as part of a 'useless project' challenge.

## Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works
- Mouse or touch events trigger animations and sound effects.
- Bubble wrap pops instantly and resets for infinite popping.
- Glass shatters in realistic patterns and fades out.

## Why It's Fun & Useless
- Completely non-productive but extremely satisfying.
- Works on any device.
- Gives the user a playful break from routine.

Enjoy popping and smashing!
